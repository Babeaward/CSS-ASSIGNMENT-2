      <p> Dr. Norman Borlaug, third from the left, trains biologist
        in Mexico on how to increase wheat yields - part of his life
        - long war on hunger.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3> Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>

  <div class="div2">
    <ul>
      <li> <strong> 1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li><br>
      <li><strong> 1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University
        of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as "National Youth Administration"</li> <br>
      <li> <strong> 1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the civillian Conservation
        Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me". </li>
      <br>
      <li> <strong> 1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Foresty Service.</li><br>
      <li> <strong> 1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets aid off due to budget cuts. Inspired
        by
        Eelvin Charles Starkman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent
        plants</li><br>
      <li> <strong> 1941</strong> - Tries to enrol in the milllitary after the Pearl Harbar attack, but is rejected.
        Instead, the milllitary asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and
        other applied science. </li><br>
      <li> <strong> 1942</strong> - Recieves a Ph.D in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li><br>
      <li> <strong> 1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and
        flies
        to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over
        the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistant wheat - including different
        varieties for each major climate on Earth. </li><br>
      <li> <strong> 1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grow wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields.</li><br>
      <li> <strong> 1953</strong> - Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yielding American breed,
        creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide
        95% of Mexico's wheat.</li><br>
      <li> <strong> 1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to Indian subcontinent in
        time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population. </li><br>
      <li> <strong> 1970</strong> - Recieves the Nobel Peace Price</li><br>
      <li> <strong> 1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields
      </li><br>
      <li> <strong> 1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li><br>
      <li> <strong> 2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050". Argues that
        genetically
        modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable lands.
        Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "weve been genetically modifying plants and animals for
        a
        long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the beast breeds." </li><br>
      <li> <strong> 2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>

    </ul><br><br><br>

    <em class="em">"Borlaug's life and achivement are testimony to the far reaching contribution that one man's towering
      intellect,
      persistence and scientific vision can make to human peace and progress" <br><br>

      -- Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</em><br>
